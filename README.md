# Assistant Management System

This repository contains the backend code for an Assistant Management System, built using Spring Boot.

## Overview

The Assistant Management System allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on assistant entities. An assistant entity typically includes attributes such as name, mobile number, email, salary, city, country, department, and role.

## Setup

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/assistant-management-system.git](https://github.com/RummanShaikh/Hirademy.git)


2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.

4. Configure the database connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

5. Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install


6. Run the application:


The application will start running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

- `GET /assistants`: Retrieve all assistants.
- `GET /assistants/{id}`: Retrieve an assistant by ID.
- `POST /assistants`: Create a new assistant.
- `PUT /assistants/{id}`: Update an existing assistant.
- `DELETE /assistants/{id}`: Delete an assistant by ID.

## Error Handling

The application handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages. For example, when attempting to retrieve, update, or delete an assistant with a non-existent ID, the API returns a 404 (NOT_FOUND) status along with an error message.
